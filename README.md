# Real Deal Tic Tac Toe

Using a min-max algorithm is a whole lot faster, simpler, and should be used in the real world instead of this machine learning bs,  and since Tic Tac Toe is a solved game an AI is totally unnecessary, but machine learning bs is more fun and interesting.

In contrast to my other Tic Tac Toe project that used min-max, this one's opponent prepares for the game by simulating a given amount of test rounds and applying what it learned against the user.
